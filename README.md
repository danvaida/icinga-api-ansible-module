# icinga-api-ansible-module

This is the playground of my first Ansible module.

Module specification can be seen in the DOCUMENTATION and RETURN sections.
I am trying to make those as solid as possible before writing any actual line of code.

Together with the examples section, you should get an idea about the functionality planned for this module.

The whole thing is nothing more than some notes on a napkin and you should keep in mind that the structure can and will most likely change.

I'm still evaluating the pros/cons of splitting the module in multiple, smaller modules, prefixed with `icinga_`.

This is WIP.

While it can be difficult to really see the value of such a module, I am confident of its utility, and hell, there's a Nagios module, so why not :)
